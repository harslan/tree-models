    "### The Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Would you rather ask:\n",
    "- ONE financial analyst about a stock price?\n",
    "- 100 financial analysts, then average their predictions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forest** = Build many decision trees and average their predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bootstrap Sampling** (Bagging):\n",
    "   - Create 100 different training datasets by randomly sampling WITH replacement\n",
    "   - Each tree sees a slightly different view of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Random Feature Selection**:\n",
    "   - At each split, only consider a random subset of features\n",
    "   - This decorrelates the trees (makes them more independent)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Aggregation**:\n",
    "   - For regression: **Average** all tree predictions\n",
    "   - For classification: **Majority vote**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Individual tree:** High variance, prone to overfitting  \n",
    "**Average of many trees:** Variance cancels out! More stable predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical intuition:**\n",
    "- If each tree has error $\\epsilon$\n",
    "- Average of $n$ independent trees has error $\\epsilon/\\sqrt{n}$\n",
    "- More trees = More stable predictions\n",

    "2. **Calculate residuals:** Find the errors (actual - predicted)\n",
    "3. **Build a tree to predict the residuals:** This tree focuses on correcting mistakes\n",
    "4. **Update predictions:** Add the new tree's predictions (scaled by learning rate)\n",
    "5. **Repeat:** Build the next tree on the NEW residuals\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Use **Linear Regression** when:\n",
    "- ✅ Relationships are approximately linear\n",
    "- ✅ You need to explain every decision to stakeholders\n",
    "- ✅ Optimization must run in real-time (< 1 second)\n",
    "- ✅ Model stability over time is critical\n",
    "- ✅ You have limited ML expertise on the team\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Daily pricing updates for 10,000 products across 500 stores\n",

    "- ✅ You have moderate computational resources\n",
    "- ✅ Feature importance insights are valuable\n",
    "- ✅ Stakeholders trust \"data-driven black boxes\"\n",
    "- ✅ The accuracy gain justifies added complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Weekly supply chain optimization for 50 products across 8 regions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use **Gradient Boosting** when:\n",
    "- ✅ Maximum accuracy is paramount (competitions, high-value decisions)\n",
    "- ✅ Optimization runs infrequently (monthly strategic planning)\n",
    "- ✅ You have strong ML expertise and computational resources\n",

    "\n",
    "### Question 1: Model Selection\n",
    "**Scenario:** You're optimizing pricing for an e-commerce platform with 10,000 products. Prices update every hour based on competitor pricing and inventory levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which model would you choose: Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting?\n",
    "- What are the key factors in your decision?\n",
    "- What might go wrong with each choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2: Explainability vs. Accuracy\n",
    "**Scenario:** Your Gradient Boosting model achieves 95% accuracy, but the CEO asks, \"Why did we set this specific price?\" and you can't give a clear answer. Your Linear Regression achieves 88% accuracy but you can explain every coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which do you deploy to production?\n",
    "- How do you handle the explainability gap?\n",
    "- Are there hybrid approaches?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: The False Precision Trap\n",
    "**Scenario:** Your model predicts demand will be 2,347,891 avocados. Your optimization sets the price at $1.8374.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is this level of precision meaningful?\n",
    "- How do you communicate uncertainty to stakeholders?\n",
    "- Should you round optimal solutions?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4: Model Drift\n",
    "**Scenario:** After 6 months in production, your Random Forest's accuracy has dropped from 92% to 78%. Market conditions changed (pandemic, competitor entry, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do you detect this in production?\n",
    "- What's your retraining strategy?\n",
    "- How does model complexity affect maintenance burden?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5: Ethical Considerations\n",
    "**Scenario:** Your model learns that certain regions tolerate higher prices. This leads to differential pricing that could be seen as discriminatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is this optimization ethical?\n",
    "- How do you balance profit maximization with fairness?\n",
    "- What constraints might you add to the optimization?\n",

    "**Test your understanding:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **True or False:** Random Forest always outperforms Gradient Boosting.\n",
    "   - *Answer: False. GB often achieves higher accuracy, but RF can be better with limited tuning or parallel processing needs.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What is the key difference between Random Forest and Gradient Boosting?**\n",
    "   - *Answer: RF builds trees independently in parallel; GB builds trees sequentially where each learns from previous errors.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why might you choose Linear Regression over Random Forest in prescriptive analytics?**\n",
    "   - *Answer: Speed, interpretability, stakeholder trust, easier maintenance, good enough accuracy for business needs.*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How does Gurobi ML embed tree-based models into optimization?**\n",
    "   - *Answer: Converts decision tree logic into linear constraints that Gurobi can solve.*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What is feature importance and why does it matter for business?**\n",
    "   - *Answer: Measures which features most influence predictions; helps prioritize data collection and informs business strategy.*\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **When is high prediction accuracy NOT the right goal?**\n",
    "   - *Answer: When stakeholders need explainability, when optimization speed matters, when maintenance burden exceeds benefit, when \"good enough\" suffices.*\n",
